# fastparse-test
A small study project on [Li Haoyi - FastParse](https://github.com/lihaoyi/fastparse), a parser-combinator library for Scala that lets you quickly and easily write recursive descent text- and binary data parsers in Scala.

# Introduction
To make sense of text, you need a way to parse it, and parser libraries such as fastparse can help you do that.

# Usage
In bash, type `sbt test`.

Have fun!
